Over the next few years, we will begin to see AR support expand, including support for the new see-through head-worn displays coming out.

For most consumers, this will be their first taste of immersive content, with a device they already have in their pocket. We\u2019ve seen millions of installs of phone-based AR apps over the last six months; expect the first big wave of ground-up designed games, branded experiences, and consumer applications to hit in 2018. Unity\u2019s Tony Parisi will talk about the implications of these developments for the immersive industry, and what the near future may look like.",

Sabarish is going to discuss the future of XR, how it's going to impact his generation, what technology providers are getting wrong and how we should be approaching the future of XR.",
